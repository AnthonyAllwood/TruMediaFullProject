# TruMediaFullProject
This is the full project repo for the TruMedia interview project. This repo contains code for the frontend and backend. 
The official project that was created and modified for deployment is in the TruMediaProjectAPI repo.
Important Note: 
This repo has a gitignore file in the backend that ignores .env. This is not necessary in the official project due to deployment reasons involving Heroku.
